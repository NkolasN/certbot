# What is Certbot?

Certbot is a fully-featured, extensible client for the Let's
Encrypt CA (or any other CA that speaks the [ACME](https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme/blob/master/draft-ietf-acme-acme.md)
protocol) that can automate the tasks of obtaining certificates and
configuring webservers to use them. This client runs on Unix-based operating
systems.

Until May 2016, Certbot was named simply ``letsencrypt`` or ``letsencrypt-auto``,
depending on install method. Instructions on the Internet, and some pieces of the
software, may still refer to this older name.

# How to use this image

The easiest way how to run Certbot image is as follow:
```
$ docker run --rm -it \
    -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
    -v <store-path>:/etc/letsencrypt
    --net=<your-network-name> \
    adop/certbot:VERSION <command>
```
Where ```command``` is ```certbot``` command.

Example:
```
certbot certonly --standalone -d ${DOMAIN_NAME} --text --register-unsafely-without-email --agree-tos"
```

after the above, the Certbot will request SSL certificates for the ```$DOMAIN_NAME``` and save it to ```<store-path>```.
